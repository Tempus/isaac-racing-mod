# Racing+ Lua Mod Changes

### Design Goals

In terms of what to change about the game, the mod has several goals, and attempts to strike a balance between them. However, certain things are prioritized. The goals are listed below in order of importance:

* to reward skillful play
* to make the game more fun to play
* to fix bugs and imperfections
* to keep the game as "vanilla" as possible

<br />

## List of Changes

### 1) Character Changes

* All characters now start with the D6 (except for Keeper, who gets to keep his useful Wooden Penny).
* Certain characters have their health changed so that they can consistently take a devil deal.
  * Judas starts with half a red heart and half a soul heart.
  * Blue Baby starts with three and a half soul hearts.
  * Azazel starts with half a red heart and half a soul heart.
* Judas starts with a bomb instead of 3 coins. (Judas is the most common character to race, so he needs to be able to get Treasure Room pedestal items surrounded by rocks.)

### 2) Devil Room and Angel Room Changes

Devil Rooms and Angel Rooms without item pedestals in them have been removed.

### 3) Item Removal

Some items with no effect at all are removed:

* the Karma trinket (all Donation Machines are removed on the BLCK CNDL seed)
* the Amnesia pill (all curses are removed on the BLCK CNDL seed)
* the ??? pill (all curses are removed on the BLCK CNDL seed)

### 4) Cutscene Removal

Cutscenes are removed. (However, there is an option in the client to re-enable boss cutscenes for racers with cutscene skip muscle memory.)

### 5) Animation Removal

Some useless animations are removed:

* cowering in the fetal position at the beginning of every floor
* jumping in a hole to the next floor
* going up the beam of light to the Cathedral
* entering a chest when going to The Chest or beating the game

### 6) Wrath of the Lamb style room clear

Room clear was incorrectly ported from Wrath of Lamb to Rebirth; doors are intended to open at the beginning of an enemy's death animation, not at the end. The Racing+ mod fixes this to be the way it was originally intended.

### 7) Room Fixes

Many rooms with unavoidable damage or bugs have been fixed or deleted. Full documentation can be found below in the "Room Changes" section.

## Changes for Custom Rulesets

Occasionally, other modified rulesets are used for racing to spice things up:

### Seeded

* All characters start with The Compass in addition to their other items.
* Teleport! and Undefined are removed from all item pools.
* The Cain's Eye trinket is removed from the game.

### Dark Room

* 4 golden chests will now spawn at the beginning of the Dark Room (instead of red chests).
* We Need To Go Deeper! is removed from all item pools.

### Mega Satan

* Pedestals for Key Piece 1 and Key Piece 2 are placed next to the Mega Satan door on both The Chest and the Dark Room.

## Room Changes

The room changes from the Afterbirth version of the Jud6s mod will be implemented after the next official Afterbirth+ patch is released by Nicalis.

## Rooms That Were Deliberately Not Changed

* Basement #274 - This is a 1x1 room with a TNT barrel to the left/right of the top/bottom entrances. However, on a knife build, if you are playing correctly, you should be pointing it towards the center of the room upon entering.
* Basement/Cellar #401 - This is a 2x1 room with 4 Pooters. If there is a tinted rock in the room, you should ignore it and hustle to kill the Pooters before they get into a soft-lock position.
* Cellar #766 - This is a 1x1 room with 3 mega troll bombs, but if you stand completely still, they will not damage you.
* Caves #161, #271, #553 - If the enemy by the top door is a explosive champion, the player will not be hit. If the enemy by the top door is a tear champion, the player has a full second to react upon entering.
* Caves #692 - This is a narrow 1x1 room filled with poops. With Ipecac, you can safely shoot left from the top right-hand corner. With Dr. Fetus, you can walk diagonally through the poops to plant your first bomb. With Dr. Fetus and Bomber Boy, it is unavoidable damage.
* Caves/Catacombs #862 - This is a room with 5 Crazy Long Legs. On a low damage build, it is possible for the spiders to come at you from every angle and cause unavoidable damage. However, spider movement is RNG dependant and actual unavoidable damage is rare.
* Catacombs #267 - This is a room with a Night Crawler right next to the bottom entrance. Night Crawler's cannot spawn as champions, so it will never explode in your face from blue flies.
* Dark Room #287 - This is a room with 3 mega troll bombs and an Imp. If you stand completely still, the troll bombs will not damage you.
* Chest #39 - This is a room with 2 Mega Maws. Even with the champion version, there is enough time to react to the patterns.
* Mama Gurdy - In Afterbirth, you have more time to dodge the spikes before the hitbox appears.
* Daddy Long Legs - In Afterbirth, the multiple stomp attack no longer damages you before the animation begins.
* Pride (narrow room) - Sometimes, the bombs spawn in such a way that it is unavoidable damage, but this is rare.
