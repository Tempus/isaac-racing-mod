# Racing+ Mod Changes

### Design Goals

In terms of what to change about the game, the mod has several goals, and attempts to strike a balance between them. However, certain things are prioritized. The goals are listed below in order of importance:

* to reward skillful play
* to make the game more fun to play
* to fix bugs and imperfections
* to keep the game as "vanilla" as possible

<br />

## List of Main Changes

#### 1) Character Changes

* All characters now start with the D6 (except for Keeper, who gets to keep his useful Wooden Penny).
* Certain characters have their health changed so that they can consistently take a devil deal.
  * Judas starts with half a red heart and half a soul heart.
  * Blue Baby starts with three and a half soul hearts.
  * Azazel starts with half a red heart and half a soul heart.
* Judas starts with a bomb instead of 3 coins. (Judas is the most common character to race, so he needs to be able to get Treasure Room pedestal items surrounded by rocks.)

#### 2) Devil Room and Angel Room Changes

Devil Rooms and Angel Rooms without item pedestals in them have been removed.

#### 3) Item Removal

Some items with no effect at all are removed:

* the Karma trinket (all Donation Machines are removed on the BLCK CNDL seed)
* the Amnesia pill (all curses are removed on the BLCK CNDL seed)
* the ??? pill (all curses are removed on the BLCK CNDL seed)

#### 4) Cutscene Removal

Cutscenes are removed. (However, there is an option in the client to re-enable boss cutscenes for racers with cutscene skip muscle memory.)

#### 5) Animation Removal

Some useless animations are removed:

* cowering in the fetal position at the beginning of every floor
* jumping in a hole to the next floor
* going up the beam of light to the Cathedral
* entering a chest when going to The Chest or beating the game

#### 6) Wrath of the Lamb style room clear

Room clear was incorrectly ported from Wrath of Lamb to Rebirth; doors are intended to open at the beginning of an enemy's death animation, not at the end. The Racing+ mod fixes this to be the way it was originally intended.

#### 7) Room Fixes

Many rooms with unavoidable damage or bugs have been fixed or deleted.

<br />

## Additional Changes for Custom Rulesets

Occasionally, other modified rulesets are used for racing to spice things up:

#### Seeded

* All characters start with The Compass in addition to their other items.
* Teleport! and Undefined are removed from all item pools.
* The Cain's Eye trinket is removed from the game.

#### Dark Room

* 4 golden chests will now spawn at the beginning of the Dark Room (instead of red chests).
* We Need To Go Deeper! is removed from all item pools.

#### Mega Satan

* Pedestals for Key Piece 1 and Key Piece 2 are placed next to the Mega Satan door on both The Chest and the Dark Room.

## Individual Room Changes

The [technical specifics of all of the individual room changes are listed in a separate document](https://github.com/Zamiell/isaac-racing-mod/blob/master/CHANGES-ROOM.md), for those who care to know the nitty-gritty details.
