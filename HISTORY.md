# Racing+ Mod Version History

Note that the Racing+ Mod version will almost always match the client version. This means that the version number of the mod may increase, but have no actual new in-game changes. All gameplay related changes will be listed below.

* *0.2.49* - February 24th
  * Keeper now starts with the D6, Greed's Gullet, Duality, and 50 cents.
  * Fixed the bug with Keeper and Greed's Gullet where he would not be able to pick up health ups.
  * Teleport! is now seeded (per floor). This item is no longer removed in seeded races.
  * Undefined is now seeded (per floor). This item is no longer removed in seeded races.
  * Telepills is now seeded (per floor, separately from Teleport!).
  * Broken Remote is now banned during seeded races. (I forgot to do this initially.)
  * When you spawn a co-op baby, it will now automatically kill the baby and delete all item pedestals in the room.
  * When you use a Sacrifice Room to teleport directly to the Dark Room, it will instead send you to the next floor.
  * Pressing the reset button on Eden now instantly kills her. (It is not possible to fix the resetting bug in a proper way.)
  * Fixed an unavoidable damage I AM ERROR room where you would teleport on top of a Spiked Chest.
  * Cleaned up the door placements on some miscellaneous I AM ERROR rooms to ensure that the player always teleports to an intended location.
  * Fixed the I AM ERROR room without any entrances.
  * Fast-clear has been recoded to fix the bug where the doors would open if you killed two splitting enemies at the same time.
  * The title screen has been updated to a beautiful new one created by Gromfaloon.
  * Fixed some more out of bounds entities.
  * Fixed an asymmetric Scarred Guts on a Womb/Utero L room (#757).
  * Fixed a Little Horn room (#1095) where there was only a narrow entrance to the top and bottom doors.
  * Deleted the 2x2 Depths/Necropolis with 2 Begottens (#422), since they automatically despawn due to a bug.
  * Fixed the bug where the damage cache was not properly updated after having Polyphemus and then picking up The Inner Eye or Mutant Spider.
  * Fixed an asymmetric Scarred Guts on a Womb/Utero L room (#757).
  * Fixed a Little Horn room (#1095) where there was only a narrow entrance to the top and bottom doors.
* *0.2.29* - February 12th
  * Changed the double Forsaken room to have two Dark Uriels.
  * All Globins will permanently die upon the 5th regeneration to prevent Epic Fetus softlocks.
  * Knights, Selfless Knights, Floating Knights, Bone Knights, Eyes, Bloodshot Eyes, Wizoobs, and Red Ghosts no longer have invulernability frames after spawning.
* *0.2.27* - February 11th
  * Fixed a room with boils that can cause a softlock with no bombs or keys.
  * Fixed the double trouble room that softlocks if you have no bombs.
  * Added a bunch of splitting enemies to the fast-clear exception list.
  * Pedestal replacement no longer applies to shops. (It causes some weird behavior.)
  * If you arrive at the Void floor for any reason, you will be automatically given the Polaroid and sent to Womb 1.
* *0.2.20* - February 8th
  * Renamed the Jud6s mod to the Racing+ mod. This should still be considered alpha software. It contains all of the room changes from the Afterbirth version of the Jud6s mod, as well as things that were not in the Afterbirth version, like Wrath of the Lamb style room clear. The full list of changes are listed on [the main changes page](https://github.com/Zamiell/isaac-racing-mod/blob/master/CHANGES.md).
